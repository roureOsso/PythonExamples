# PythonExamples
Here you will fine some nice python examples, exercices and explanations for different topics, some of them CG related. 

I DO NOT claim the authorship for all the examplese that can be found here, from time to time you can found really nice stuf out there so I though that it would be nice to have everything on the same place.
